# Sentiment Analysis Application

## Overview

This project is a simple sentiment analysis application built using Electron. The application analyzes the emotional tone of user-inputted text and displays the result.

## Requirements

Node.js and npm installed on the system
A code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Atom, Sublime Text)
Project Structure

## The project consists of the following files:

* package.json: Project configuration file
* main.js: Electron application entry point
* index.html: Application user interface HTML file
* renderer.js: JavaScript file for interacting with the user interface
* sentiment.js: Sentiment analysis module

## Setup

* Create a new project folder and navigate to it in the terminal/command prompt.
* Run npm install to install the required dependencies.
* Run npm start to start the application.
* Open the application in the browser.

## Application Functionality

1. The user inputs text into the text area.
2. The user clicks the "Analyze Sentiment" button.
3. The sentiment analysis module analyzes the text and returns the result.
4. The result is displayed in the result area.

## Sentiment Analysis Module

The sentiment analysis module uses the sentiment library to analyze the text. The module exports a single function, analyzeSentiment, which takes the text as input and returns the sentiment analysis result.

## Code

The code is written in JavaScript and uses the Electron framework. The main.js file creates the application window and loads the index.html file. The renderer.js file interacts with the user interface and calls the sentiment analysis module.

## Improvement Ideas

* Improve the user interface using HTML and CSS.
* Use a more advanced sentiment analysis library or train a custom model.
* Add more features, such as text summarization or language translation.
* Explore other Electron features, such as menus and system tray icons.

## Troubleshooting

If the application does not start, check the terminal/command prompt for errors.
If the sentiment analysis module does not work, check the sentiment.js file for errors.
